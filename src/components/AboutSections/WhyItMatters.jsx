            Documentation is the foundation of accountability. When crimes are recorded, verified
            and shared with the public and formal institutions, denial becomes difficult and
            pathways to justice are established. The Rohingya crisis includes patterns of
            violence that span generations. Without a durable record, societies may normalize
            denial and survivors lose access to redress.

            This work also counters the erasure that results when evidence remains hidden, when
            official narratives omit civilian suffering, or when false narratives replace the
            testimony of survivors. Documented evidence supports humanitarian planning and
            protects the historical memory of communities that bear the consequences of violence.
